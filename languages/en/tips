A form is a window of the program but can also be a game scene.
A component is a visual or functional element of the program.
A module is a named set of components and functionality for forms and more.
Each module has a property "Singleton", which significantly alters the module's behavior.
The special module "Loader" allows performing actions at the program start.
To work with a module and its components from a form, you need to attach the module to the form.
Use the "Modules" property of the form to attach a module to the form.
Each component can be given behavior that adds something new to the component.
Each project can connect an extension package through the "Project" tab.
The project name can be changed in the "Project" tab.
